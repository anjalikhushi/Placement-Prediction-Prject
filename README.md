## How to Perform:

To perform a machine learning project using this dataset, you could explore the relationships between various features and the "status" column. This could involve analyzing which factors have a significant impact on whether an applicant is placed in a job or not. Based on this analysis, you could build a machine learning model to predict the placement status of future job applicants given their educational background and other relevant factors. The analysis and design of such a project would involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
